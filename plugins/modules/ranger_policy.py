    support: full
  diff_mode:
    description:
      - This module supports diff mode.
    support: full
    platforms:
      - all
notes:
  - When O(merged=false) (default), the module performs full replacements of existing policies rather than merges.
  - If the desired state differs from the current policy, the existing policy is fully overwritten with the new definition.
  - This guarantees consistent, predictable updates and avoids the risk of duplicate or conflicting entries.
  - When O(merged=true), the module concatenates lists (users, groups, accesses) with the existing ones.
  - Merge mode is useful for adding users, groups, or accesses to existing policies without specifying all current values.
  - Values already present are not duplicated when merging.
